This PHP package can be used to browse listings of entries split in multiple pages.

The format of records can be MySQL, CSV or plain array.

The class can generate a HTML list with links to browse the listing pages,
optionally with links to the previous, next, first and last pages.

The URLs and text labels of the links are configurable.
